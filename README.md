The project consists of three parts:

1. Physics Engine

  This is essentially a C++ library that handles 2D mechanics. Using this library, clients may develop ASCII art games that can be played over terminal.

2. The First ASCII Art Game : Air

  This is an air combat game that contains multiple levels. The player can control a fighting plane to move around and shoot bullets to attack enemies. The player earns scores by killing enemies and will move on to the next level/win the game by earning enough scores. The player can be damaged or even killed by these enemies.
When there are too many enemies, the player may summon a nuclear bomb.

3. The Second ASCII Art Game : Jump

  The player is locked in a building of four rooms. A secret box is re-generated in every 60 ticks at a random location in this building. To escape the building, the player needs to go to the right room and hit the box as fast as possible and collect the scores in the box, otherwise the box will disappear and get re-generated.
